    Create a new Express app (the express generator is recommended)

    express --view=none my-cool-site

    Write tests for a Users model.
        Examples
        Check that a user can be found in a database
        Check that a user is an object
        Check for a user to be an instance of the User class
    Write a Users model that passes the tests you've written.

Exercise 2:

Fork a copy of this repo: https://github.com/torchcodelab/skatepark-review-tdd

    Clone YOUR FORK of the repo locally.
    Create a new branch:

    git checkout -b my-new-branch-name

    Look in:

    test/tests.js

    There is a test in there for the Parks model. Currently, this test is failing. Your job is to read the test, and write a function that makes the test pass.
    Push your changes up to Github, and submit a PR against my repo with the changes.
